Git Receive Pack Proxy HTTP
===========================

Normal chain of processes when invoking Git push is:


gsp <-> ssh <----> ssh <-> grp

Where gsp is git-send-pack and grp is git-receive-pack.
This executable acts as a proxy between gsp and grp 
and a http Git server forwarding traffic between them:

gsp <-> ssh <----> ssh <-> grp-proxy <-> grp
                               |
                               +----> HTTP Git Server

The grp-proxy takes a copy of the packfile and stores
a copy in /tmp. The proxy forwards the advertise 
refs call to grp, the packfile + updates it wraps into
HTTP and sends to the HTTP Git Server. The Git HTTP
server and grp must resolve to the same repo - this is 
fiddly at the minute.



Build
======
Build requires libevent2 and OpenSSL libraries

On Ubuntu 12.04:

    sudo apt-get install libevent-2.0-5 libevent-extra-2.0-5 \
                    libevent-dev libssl-dev

To build
    make


The executable that is built is grp-proxy (git receive pack proxy).

Running
=======
To use:

    git push --receive-pack=/home/mmk/grp-proxy/grp-proxy

Where the path is the to grp-proxy on the machine you are
pushing to. The HTTP Git server must be running on 127.0.0.1
and port 8080, it must be configured to allow anynomous 
receive-pack.

Third party licenses
====================

http_parser.c and http_parser.h have a BSD style license included in them.
